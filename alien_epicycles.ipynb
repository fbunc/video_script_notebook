    "\n",
    "This story takes place in a fictional earth-alike planet called Tau, imagine this planet existing inside a fictional toy-universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "After providing some initial context we will focus the story in  the  way some mathematical ideas evolved over time in this fictional planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had some doubt's on how to define prerequisites to understand the video so I share an alternative title:How Complex Fourier Series where discovered in a fictional planet called Tau\n",
    "\n",
    "Fret not, to understand this story you don't need to understand Complex Fourier Series and Epicycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will be helpful though , if you are already acquainted with the idea of vectors, polar coordinates , and some basic idea of what a Complex Number is here in planet Earth. In the description I will add some links to good introductory videos to the basic ideas that could be thought as pre-requisites to understand and fully enjoy this video. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Tau things are similar, but not the same. For example, they call Compass Number to the same idea of a 2D number, but because of different evolution in math discoveries over time, they ended up with different associations of ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discover and imagine how some mathematical ideas where discovered in this fictional planet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine Tau in a much earlier stage of scientific evolution compared to Earth, less industrialized and with it's population enjoying  peace and prosperity. You can imagine your own version of Tau while you follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Math was sacred in Tau, mathematical ideas where taught to everyone as the way to engage people with the cosmos and it's mysteries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Math was also taught as a tool to understand how all their society-building-technologies worked, how to fix them and how to improve them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Math was the way music was described. One of the main books called The JSB Well-tempered Clavier.Each of these revelations contain 24 fugues written in each of twelve major and twelve minor keys and demonstrated that using an equal tempered scale, music could be written in, and shifted to any key.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the books that was widely know was called Ebib Signals. The myth says that a signal from an unknown source was decoded by a group of young students and the content of that signal was the key to understand a little better their solar system and beyond. More on this later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tau calendar has 360 days in a year \n",
    "\n",
    "For reasons we are going to explore further, Tau used a widely accepted calendar given by 12 months of 30 days each. \n",
    "Months where numbered from 0 to 29. Days of the week where numbered from 0 to 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tau's sky had a glow with a shifting color with 24 distinguishable hues during the day. \n",
    "Tau's day was 24 hs, and they used counter-clockwise mod 24 clocks with each hour related to a color in what we call HSV. This color was a representation of the actual glow they see in the sky at each hour of the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tau's moon was similar to ours, but it always took exactly 30 days to do a full turn around it's orbit.  (as they first measurements indicated) .\n",
    "\n",
    "Tau also packed seasons, and called them  quadrants : first ,second and third \n",
    "\n",
    "## Toy solar system as was initially understood in Tau planet\n",
    "\n",
    "It's earth-alike in many ways, for example in the way that they experience and understand celestial mechanics , time , motion and change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tau's Newton became a good friend with Tau's Leibniz and there where no issues  accepting that the idea of absolute or relative space and time where just helpful constructs to model our observations from different perspectives.  Their culture and language it's really similar , and all mathematical discoveries in Tau's history can be mapped to Earth's mathematical discoveries but where expressed differently and happened in a different order. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discover and easily introduce each discovery in this fictional planet in a way it's friendly for different math understanding levels in the audience. The aim will be to be playful to engage with beginners but also sufficiently precise and mathematically correct to make it enjoyable to someone that has more familiarity with these topics. \n",

    "# Quote from a stanford book Prof. Brad Osgood\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods based on the Fourier transform are used in virtually all areas of engineering and science and by\n",
    "virtually all engineers and scientists. For starters:\n",
    "• Circuit designers\n",
    "• Spectroscopists\n",
    "• Crystallographers\n",
    "• Anyone working in signal processing and communications\n",
    "• Anyone working in imaging\n",
    "I’m expecting that many fields and many interests will be represented in the class, and this brings up an\n",
    "important issue for all of us to be aware of. With the diversity of interests and backgrounds present not\n",
    "all examples and applications will be familiar and of relevance to all people. We’ll all have to cut each\n",
    "other some slack, and it’s a chance for all of us to branch out. Along the same lines, it’s also important for\n",
    "you to realize that this is one course on the Fourier transform among many possible courses. The richness\n",
    "of the subject, both mathematically and in the range of applications, means that we’ll be making choices\n",
    "almost constantly. Books on the subject do not look alike, nor do they look like these notes — even the\n",
    "notation used for basic objects and operations can vary from book to book. I’ll try to point out when a\n",
    "certain choice takes us along a certain path, and I’ll try to say something of what the alternate paths may\n",
    "be.\n",
    "The very first choice is where to start, and my choice is a brief treatment of Fourier series.1 Fourier analysis\n",
    "was originally concerned with representing and analyzing periodic phenomena, via Fourier series, and later\n",
    "with extending those insights to nonperiodic phenomena, via the Fourier transform. In fact, one way of\n",
    "getting from Fourier series to the Fourier transform is to consider nonperiodic phenomena (and thus just\n",
    "about any general function) as a limiting case of periodic phenomena as the period tends to infinity. A\n",
    "discrete set of frequencies in the periodic case becomes a continuum of frequencies in the nonperiodic case,\n",
    "the spectrum is born, and with it comes the most important principle of the subject:\n",
    "Every signal has a spectrum and is determined by its spectrum. You can analyze the signal\n",
    "either in the time (or spatial) domain or in the frequency domain.\n",
    "1 Bracewell, for example, starts right off with the Fourier transform and picks up a little on Fourier series later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I think this qualifies as a Major Secret of the Universe.**\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this was thoroughly grounded in physical applications. Most often the phenomena to be studied\n",
    "were modeled by the fundamental differential equations of physics (heat equation, wave equation, Laplace’s\n",
    "equation), and the solutions were usually constrained by boundary conditions. At first the idea was to use\n",
    "Fourier series to find explicit solutions.\n",
    "This work raised hard and far reaching questions that led in different directions. It was gradually realized\n",
    "that setting up Fourier series (in sines and cosines) could be recast in the more general framework of orthogonality, linear operators, and eigenfunctions. That led to the general idea of working with eigenfunction\n",
    "expansions of solutions of differential equations, a ubiquitous line of attack in many areas and applications.\n",
    "In the modern formulation of partial differential equations, the Fourier transform has become the basis\n",
    "for defining the objects of study, while still remaining a tool for solving specific equations. Much of this\n",
    "development depends on the remarkable relation between Fourier transforms and convolution, something\n",
    "which was also seen earlier in the Fourier series days. In an effort to apply the methods with increasing\n",
    "generality, mathematicians were pushed (by engineers and physicists) to reconsider how general the notion\n",
    "of “function” can be, and what kinds of functions can be — and should be — admitted into the operating\n",
    "theater of calculus. Differentiation and integration were both generalized in the service of Fourier analysis.\n",
    "Other directions combine tools from Fourier analysis with symmetries of the objects being analyzed. This\n",
    "might make you think of crystals and crystallography, and you’d be right, while mathematicians think of\n",
    "number theory and Fourier analysis on groups. Finally, I have to mention that in the purely mathematical\n",
    "realm the question of convergence of Fourier series, believe it or not, led G. Cantor near the turn of the\n",
    "20th century to investigate and invent the theory of infinite sets, and to distinguish different sizes of infinite sets, all of which led to Cantor going insane.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the course with Fourier series is to begin with periodic functions, those functions which exhibit\n",
    "a regularly repeating pattern. It shouldn’t be necessary to try to sell periodicity as an important physical\n",
    "(and mathematical) phenomenon — you’ve seen examples and applications of periodic behavior in probably\n",
    "(almost) every class you’ve taken. I would only remind you that periodicity often shows up in two varieties,\n",
    "sometimes related, sometimes not. Generally speaking we think about periodic phenomena according to\n",
    "whether they are periodic in time or periodic in space.\n",
    "1.2.1 Time and space\n",
    "In the case of time the phenomenon comes to you. For example, you stand at a fixed point in the ocean (or\n",
    "on an electrical circuit) and the waves (or the electrical current) wash over you with a regular, recurring\n",
    "pattern of crests and troughs. The height of the wave is a periodic function of time. Sound is another\n",
    "example: “sound” reaches your ear as a longitudinal pressure wave, a periodic compression and rarefaction\n",
    "of the air. In the case of space, you come to the phenomenon. You take a picture and you observe repeating\n",
    "patterns.\n",
    "Temporal and spatial periodicity come together most naturally in wave motion. Take the case of one\n",
    "spatial dimension, and consider a single sinusoidal wave traveling along a string (for example). For such a\n",
    "wave the periodicity in time is measured by the frequency ν, with dimension 1/sec and units Hz (Hertz =\n",
    "cycles per second), and the periodicity in space is measured by the wavelength λ, with dimension length\n",
    "and units whatever is convenient for the particular setting. If we fix a point in space and let the time\n",
    "vary (take a video of the wave motion at that point) then successive crests of the wave come past that\n",
    "1.2 Periodic Phenomena 3\n",
    "point ν times per second, and so do successive troughs. If we fix the time and examine how the wave is\n",
    "spread out in space (take a snapshot instead of a video) we see that the distance between successive crests\n",
    "is a constant λ, as is the distance between successive troughs. The frequency and wavelength are related\n",
    "through the equation v = λν, where v is the speed of propagation — this is nothing but the wave version\n",
    "of speed = distance/time. Thus the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength, and the lower the\n",
    "frequency the longer the wavelength. If the speed is fixed, like the speed of electromagnetic waves in a\n",
    "vacuum, then the frequency determines the wavelength and vice versa; if you can measure one you can find\n",
    "the other. For sound we identify the physical property of frequency with the perceptual property of pitch,\n",
    "for light frequency is perceived as color. Simple sinusoids are the building blocks of the most complicated\n",

    "Greetings, fellow math enthusiasts! Today, we will embark on a journey to a fictional planet called *Tau*, and explore how some mathematical ideas evolved over time on this planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully enjoy this adventure, it would be helpful to have some background knowledge about vectors, polar coordinates, and basic complex numbers. Here are some useful introductory videos to get you up to speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Tau*, the inhabitants refer to 2D numbers as Compass Numbers. However, due to different mathematical discoveries over time, these numbers have unique associations and significance in their world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into our topic for today: Alien Epicycles and Compass Numbers. To begin our story, imagine a fictional planet called *Tau* that exists inside a toy-universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this planet, the inhabitants were puzzled by the movements of objects in their night sky. They observed that certain celestial bodies would appear to move in one direction and then suddenly change direction. After much observation and thought, they came up with the idea of epicycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epicycles are the paths that celestial bodies appear to follow when viewed from Earth. The idea is that these bodies actually travel in circular orbits around a central point, but each orbit is slightly tilted and shifted relative to the previous one. This creates an illusion of forward and backward motion when viewed from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this idea worked for explaining the movements of the celestial bodies, the inhabitants of *Tau* soon realized that it was not a precise model. They needed a more accurate way to describe and predict the movements of objects in their night sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to the discovery of Complex Fourier Series. Complex Fourier Series allowed them to map any real sequence to a complex sequence, adding structure and contextual information to the data. By using these series, they were able to create more precise models of the movements of celestial bodies and predict future occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, by using Complex Fourier Series, the inhabitants of *Tau* were able to accurately explain and predict the movements of celestial bodies in their night sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there you have it, the story of Alien Epicycles and Compass Numbers. I hope you've learned something new and interesting today. Until next time, keep exploring the fascinating world of math!"
